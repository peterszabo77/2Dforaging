# 2Dforaging
Reinforcement learning of moving/foraging agents on a 2D surface

## About

A reinforcement learning (Q-learning with a convolutional neural network) in a biological context.
Foraging agents are moving on a 2D surface, where food items appear randomly. The foragers, that see their neighbourhood
within a small radius, need to learn to move in the direction of the food items.

## Techniques

- Python
- pyTorch
- wxPython
